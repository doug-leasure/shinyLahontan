<h3>Project Overview</h3>

The <b>Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Population Simulator</b> forecasts population dynamics and evaluates extinction risks under different management and climate scenarios.  The app is powered by a Bayesian MPVA model (Multi-Population Viability Analysis) that was developed as part of NASA's Ecological Forecasting Program.
Lahontan cutthroat trout (<i>Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi</i>) is a federally threatened subspecies of cutthroat trout with dozens of imperiled populations scattered among isolated headwater streams draining into the Great Basin Desert.<br><br>

The Lahontan MPVA model is driven by a database that was collected over several decades by dedicated people from state and federal agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and others. The database includes fish counts from over 6,000 electrofishing surveys from 1985 to 2015 at almost 4,000 sites in 155 distinct populations.<br><br>

Stream conditions for each population were measured annually from 1985 to 2015 using remote sensing, geospatial data, and field surveys to estimate:<br>
stream temperature, stream flow, riparian vegetation condition, and non-native trout densities.<br><br>

This simulator allows you to forecast population dynamics for each population based on its historical environmental conditions or variations on them.<br><br>

<h3>Update History</h3>

<b>Version 1.0  [25 April 2017]</b><br>
Original release.<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>Version 1.1  [12 Oct 2017]</b><br>
Added batch processing capability to the Shiny app.<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>Version 2.0  [7 November 2017]</b><br>
Includes a data update from 18 May 2017:<br>
- Updated Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT) data to include 6641 total observations from 155 populations.<br>
- Updated non-native trout data<br>
- Updated LCT reintroduction data<br>
- Updated site drainage areas<br>
<br>
Includes a data update from 15 June 2017:<br>
- Average elevation for each population<br>
<br>
Model updates:<br>
- Estimated the effect NDVI separately for high and low elevation populations (i.e. mean elevation above or below 2000m)<br>
- Environmental stochasticity modeled slightly different (Hierarchical half-Cauchy rather than Gamma distribution).<br>
- Sampling model restructured to estimate site abundances.<br>
- Detection probabilities modeled as a deterministic function rather than using Beta regressions with residual observation error.<br>
- MPVA model fit to updated dataset.<br>
